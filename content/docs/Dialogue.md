# Analysis of the character's personalities

In this section, we will analyze the characters background based on solely plain text form the wiki pages and their dialogue.

## Most descriptive words

We use the pages from [The Office Wiki](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page), for each character to extract some descriptive adjectives and verbs that define the character's background, lifestyle and personality. There are many characters, so we will focus only of the 5 characters with most screen time in The Office, Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam and Andy.

- One can see that a company jargon is very common amongst all three characters, such as "office", "staff", "job", "client" or "company".

- `Michael` also has the words "parody", "manager", and "salesman". These words define his fondness for making pariodies of characters, as well as his positions throughout his career at Dunder Mifflin. 

- `Jim` has the words "stamford", another branch he was transferred to for a period, as well as "prank", since he is constantly pranking Dwight.

- For `Pam` we see "art", which is her passion, and words that link her to Jim such as "wedding", "dating" or "relationship".

- For `Dwight` we have more descriptive words that match his personality, such as "german", making reference to his ancestry, "farm", where he lives or "sheriff", which he volunteers for in his spare time.

- Finally, for `Andy` we see "salesman", his past position and "regional manager", what he becomes after Michael leaves.

## Dialogue

Now let's do the same, but looking at their dialogue. We can gain insights about the way they actually talk, which could show a lot about their character.
