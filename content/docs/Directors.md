# Directors

From the [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kapastor/the-office-imdb-ratings-per-episode), we will also analyse the most frequent and most popular directors. There were 54 total directors throughout the show, many of who only directed 1 or 2 episodes. We will focus only on the top 10 most frequent directors.

The graph above shows the 10 most frequent directors, sorted in descending order from left to right by # of episodes directed, with their respective average ratings. 

We see that Paul Feig has not only the highest average rating, but had also directed the most episodes (15 total episodes), nearly 8% of the entire show, particularly in seasons 2, 4, and 5. He then returned in season 6 to direct `Niagra Parts 1 and 2`, and in season 7 to direct `Goodbye, Michael`. As discussed in [Ratings](Ratings.md), these three episodes were amongst the most popular of the entire show. Moreover, he directed `Dinner Party` - which is supposedly Steve Carell's favorite episode. Hereby, he is both the most frequent and most popular director across the entire show.


We also note that Paul Liberstein (Toby) is among the top 10 directors of the show.
