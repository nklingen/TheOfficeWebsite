# Ratings

## Plot

![ratings]({{<baseurl>}}/images/ratings_seasons.png)

We see the ratings climb in seasons 1 and 2, then peak in seasons 3. Season 4 slightly decreases on average, yet also has a much higher variance. Thus the quality between episodes themselves varies much more in this season. We see the decrease in ratings continue until season 7, where it climbs again briefly, before a dramatic decline in seasons 8 and 9.

## Analysis of Notable Top Episodes

- `Goodbye Michael`: This is the [final episode featuring Michael Scott as the main character](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Goodbye,_Michael?so=search), and is [regarded by many critics as the "series finale", as the series declined in quality after Michael's depature][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodbye,_Michael]. After he leaves, we see that the ratings crumble and the show cannot recover, spare the series Finale which he also appears in. 

- In `Stress Relief`, [Dwight stages a fire to test the office's fire safetly skills](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Stress_Relief). However, Stanley suffers a heart attack during the stress of the "drill". Afterwards, corporate organises a CPR training session, which becomes a fan favorite as one of the best scenes in the entire show.

## Analysis of Notable Worst Episodes

- `Get The Girl` features [Andy driving across the country to Tallahassee win over Erin](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Get_the_Girl?so=search). [The Andy-Erin relationship received a lot of criticism by fans](https://screenrant.com/the-office-worst-episodes-imdb/). Even the actress portraying Erin, Ellie Kemper, didn't find Andy and Erin to be a good match. ["Is that terrible to say? I don’t know, I felt like Andy was a bit too childish. I don’t think he was ready to take care of Erin the way she needed to be. I think Erin was ready to take care of him, but I felt like it was uneven in that respect."](https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2553336/why-the-offices-ellie-kemper-wasnt-exactly-a-fan-of-erin-and-andys-relationship).

- In `The Banker`, [an investment banker comes to the office to speak with Toby, since the company has recently been bought out](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/The_Banker). This episode is mainly a clip show of previous episodes, with little new content.

Interestingly, Stress Relief from the Top Episodes and The Banker from Worst Episodes were both directed by the same director: Jeffrey Blitz. Additionally, Get the Girl, also amongst the worst episodes, was directed by Rainn Wilson, who plays Dwight in the series.
