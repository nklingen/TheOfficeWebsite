### Ratings per Season

![ratings]({{<baseurl>}}/images/ratings_seasons.png)

We overall see the rating climb in seasons 1 and 2, then peak in seasons 3. Season 4 slightly decreases in the averageratings, yet has a much higher variance. Thus the quality between episodes themselves varies much more in this season. We see the decrease in ratings continue until season 7, where it climbs again, before a dramatic decline in season 8.

In the image above, all ratings across all seasons are plotted. Moreover, the seasons are indicated with the verticle dashed lines, and the top 3 best and worst episodes are marked and labelled. 

### Analysis of Top Episodes

- `Goodbye Michael`: This episode is the final episode to feature Michael Scott as the series's main character, and is regarded by many critics as the "series finale", as the series received much criticism for a decline in quality after Michael's departure. We can make the case that Michael was the true main character. After he leaves, we see that the ratings crumble and the show cannot recover.

- In `Stress Relief`, Dwight stages a fire in the office to test the office's fire safety skills, but things go from bad to worse when Stanley suffers a heart attack, causing Michael to come up with ways to relieve stress in the office, including a comedic roast of himself. Meanwhile, Andy, Jim, and Pam watch an illegally downloaded movie at work guest-starring Jack Black, Jessica Alba and Cloris Leachman.

The chaotic cold open scene becomes one of the top fan favorite scenes from the entire show.
Both parts of `Stress Relief` originally aired together on February 1, 2009, immediately following NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII, and The Office writers and producers sought to attract newcomers to the series with the expected increase in viewership. It had 22.9 million viewers - making it one of the most viewed episode of The Office.

### Analysis of Worst Episodes

- `Get The Girl` featured Andy driving across the country to Tallahassee to track down Erin. He tries to serenade her in an extremely cringy scene and just does quite a few rather absurd things in an attempt to win Erin's heart. The Andy-Erin relationship received a lot of criticism by fans.

Even the actress portraying Erin, Ellie Kemper, never thought Andy and Erin were a good match. "Is that terrible to say? I don’t know, I felt like Andy was a bit too childish. I don’t think he was ready to take care of Erin the way she needed to be. I think Erin was ready to take care of him, but I felt like it was uneven in that respect."

- We also want to discuss the biggest outlier in the ratings: In `The Banker`, an investment banker comes to the office to speak with Toby, since the company has recently been bought out. This episode is just montages of previous episodes, with very little new content.
