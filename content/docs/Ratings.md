### Ratings per Season

![ratings]({{<baseurl>}}/images/ratings_seasons.png)

We overall see the rating climb in seasons 1 and 2, then peak in seasons 3. Season 4 slightly decreases in the averageratings, yet has a much higher variance. Thus the quality between episodes themselves varies much more in this season. We see the decrease in ratings continue until season 7, where it climbs again, before a dramatic decline in season 8.

### Analysis of 2 Top Episodes

- `Goodbye Michael`: This is the [final episode featuring Michael Scott as the main character](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Goodbye,_Michael?so=search), and is [regarded by many critics as the "series finale", as the series declined in quality after Michael's depature][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodbye,_Michael]. After he leaves, we see that the ratings crumble and the show cannot recover, spare the series Finale which he also appears in. 

- In `Stress Relief`, [Dwight stages a fire to test the office's fire safetly skills](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Stress_Relief). However, Stanley suffers a heart attack during the stress of the "drill". Afterwards, corportate organises a CPR training session, which becomes a fan favorite as one of the best scenes in the entire show.

### Analysis of 2 Worst Episodes

- `Get The Girl` features [Andy driving across the country to Tallahassee win over Erin](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Get_the_Girl?so=search). [The Andy-Erin relationship received a lot of criticism by fans](https://screenrant.com/the-office-worst-episodes-imdb/). Even the actress portraying Erin, Ellie Kemper, didn't find Andy and Erin to be a good match. ["Is that terrible to say? I don’t know, I felt like Andy was a bit too childish. I don’t think he was ready to take care of Erin the way she needed to be. I think Erin was ready to take care of him, but I felt like it was uneven in that respect."](https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2553336/why-the-offices-ellie-kemper-wasnt-exactly-a-fan-of-erin-and-andys-relationship). This episode was actually directed by Rainn Wilson, who plays Dwight in the series.

- In `The Banker`, [an investment banker comes to the office to speak with Toby, since the company has recently been bought out](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/The_Banker). This episode is mainly a clip show of previous episodes, with little new content.

Interestingly, Stress Relief and The Banker were both had the same director, Jeffrey Blitz.
