# Analysis of the character's personalities

In this section, we will analyze the characters background based on solely plain text form the wiki pages and their dialogue.

## Most descriptive words

We use the pages from [The Office Wiki](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page), for each character to extract some descriptive adjectives and verbs that define the character's background, lifestyle and personality. There are many characters, so we will focus only of the 5 characters with most screen time in The Office, Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam and Andy.

Generally, we see that a company jargon is very common amongst all three characters, such as "office", "staff", "job", "client" or "company".

`Michael` also has the words "parody", "manager", and "salesman". These words define his fondness for making pariodies of characters, as well as his positions throughout his career at Dunder Mifflin. We also find the word "friend", potentially related to his deepest desire to make friendships at work.


![Dwight_Schrute_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/Dwight_Schrute_wiki.png)
For `Dwight` we see more descriptive words that match his personality, such as "german", making reference to his ancestry, "farm", where he lives or "sheriff", which he volunteers for in his spare time. We also very interestingly see the words "family" and "child" amongst the most prominent words. There are even words related to his strong fighting instinct, such as "dodge", "attack", and "fight" and "war". Lastly, we see "beets" and "bears".

![Jim_Halpert_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/Jim_Halpert_wiki.png)
`Jim` has the words "stamford", another branch he was transferred to for a period, as well as "prank", since he is constantly pranking Dwight. He has some links to his family with Pam as well, such as "daughter" and "relationship".

![Pam_Beesly_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/Pam_Beesly_wiki.png)
For `Pam` we see "art", which is her passion, and words that link her to Jim such as "wedding", "dating" or "relationship", and "child".

![Andy_Bernard_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/Andy_Bernard_wiki.png)

Finally, for `Andy` we see "new", potentially linked to the fact that he joined the cast later than the other main characters, as many links to his job: "staff", "office", "manager", "job", "regional", "branch", and "sale". He also had the word "relationship", potentially related to Erin and his deep-rooted need to find love throughout his character arc. Lasly, we found "anger", which relates to his initial character traits of lacking anger management skills.

## Dialogue

Now let's do the same, but looking at their dialogue. We can gain insights about the way they actually talk, which could show a lot about their character.
