# Personality Analysis

In this section, we will analyze the characters background based on solely plain text form the wiki pages and their dialogue.

## Wiki Page Analysis

We use the pages from [The Office Wiki](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page), for each character to extract some descriptive adjectives and verbs that define the character's background, lifestyle and personality. We will focus on the 5 characters with most screen time in The Office: Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam and Andy.

Generally, we see that company jargon is very common amongst all three characters, such as "office", "staff", "job", "client" and "company".

### Michael
![Michael_Scott_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/Michael_Scott_wiki.png)

`Michael` has the words "parody", "manager", and "salesman". These words define his fondness for making parodies of characters, as well as his positions throughout his career at Dunder Mifflin. We also find the word "friend", potentially related to his deepest desire to make friendships at work.

### Dwight
![Dwight_Schrute_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/Dwight_Schrute_wiki.png)
For `Dwight` we see more descriptive words that match his ancestry, such as "german" and "amish", "farm" where he lives, and "sheriff", where he volunteers in his spare time. We also very interestingly see the words "family" and "child" amongst the most prominent words - which could be related to his relationship and child-rearing contract with Angela. There are even words related to his fighting instinct, such as "dodge", "attack", and "fight" and "war". 

Lastly, we see "beets" and "bears".

### Jim

![Jim_Halpert_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/Jim_Halpert_wiki.png)
`Jim` has the words "stamford", a branch of Dunder Mifflin he was transferred to for some time. He also has "prank", since he is constantly pranking Dwight. Finally, he has some links to his family with Pam as well, such as "daughter" and "relationship".

### Pam
![Pam_Beesly_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/Pam_Beesly_wiki.png)
For `Pam` we see "art", which is her passion, and words that link her to Jim such as "wedding", "dating" or "relationship", and "child".

### Andy
![Andy_Bernard_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/Andy_Bernard_wiki.png)

Finally, for `Andy` we see "new", potentially linked to the fact that he joined the cast later than the other main characters, as many links to his job: "staff", "office", "manager", "job", "regional", "branch", and "sale". He also had the word "relationship", potentially related to Erin and his deep-rooted need to find love throughout his character arc. Lasly, we found "anger", which relates to his initial character traits of lacking anger management skills.

## Dialogue Analysis

Now we do the same, but looking at their dialogue throughout the series. We can gain insights about the way they actually talk, which could show a lot about their character.

However in this case, the majority of words used in the dialogue, are, as espected, not that usefull in terms of describing the charactersÂ´ personalities, since they are mostly natural interaction language words that do not carry much meaning. There are still some information that we can pick up on.

### Michael
![michael_w]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/michael_w.PNG)

One can see the names of the people Michael most interacts with, such as Dwight, Pam and Jan and "party" seems to be in his mind, since he always wants to turn events into parties.

### Dwight
![dwight_w]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/dwight_w.PNG)

For Dwight, we see that he interacts a lot with Michael, often by exclaiming his name, and Jim, often complaining about his pranks to Michael. We also see "Schrute", his surname, which he makes reference to when talking about his family and his german farmer roots.

### Jim
![jim_w]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/jim_w.PNG)

Jim doesn't have many descriptive words, since he is often quite sarcastic, specially when interacting with Michael and Dwight, and he usually says a lot from his facial expressions alone.

### Pam
![pam_w]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/pam_w.PNG)

For Pam one can observe she mainly interacts with Michael in the office, since she is the secretary, and then with Jim. One can tell she is more insecure, with words such as "think", "sorry", "um" or "uh".

### Andy
![andy_w]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/andy_w.PNG)

Finally, from Andy, one can see that he uses "right" a lot, which could make reference to him being a people-pleaser and agreeing to everything. We also see Erin inhis wordcloud, which is his girlfriend.


### That's what she said!

Any The Office fan knows Michael Scott's most famous phrase ...
