# Personality Analysis

In this section, we will analyze the characters background based on solely plain text form the wiki pages and their dialogue.

## Wiki Page Analysis

We use the pages from [The Office Wiki](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page), for each character to extract some descriptive adjectives and verbs that define the character's background, lifestyle and personality. We will focus on the 5 characters with most screen time in The Office: Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam and Andy.

Generally, we see that company jargon is very common amongst all three characters, such as "office", "staff", "job", "client" and "company".

### Michael
![Michael_Scott_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/Michael_Scott_wiki.png)

`Michael` has the words "parody", "manager", and "salesman". These words define his fondness for making parodies of characters, as well as his positions throughout his career at Dunder Mifflin. We also find the word "friend", potentially related to his deepest desire to make friendships at work.

### Dwight
![Dwight_Schrute_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/Dwight_Schrute_wiki.png)
For `Dwight` we see more descriptive words that match his ancestry, such as "german" and "amish", "farm" where he lives, and "sheriff", where he volunteers in his spare time. We also very interestingly see the words "family" and "child" amongst the most prominent words - which could be related to his relationship and child-rearing contract with Angela. There are even words related to his fighting instinct, such as "dodge", "attack", and "fight" and "war". 

Lastly, we see "beets" and "bears".

### Jim

![Jim_Halpert_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/Jim_Halpert_wiki.png)
`Jim` has the words "stamford", a branch of Dunder Mifflin he was transferred to for some time. He also has "prank", since he is constantly pranking Dwight. Finally, he has some links to his family with Pam as well, such as "daughter" and "relationship".

### Pam
![Pam_Beesly_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/Pam_Beesly_wiki.png)
For `Pam` we see "art", which is her passion, and words that link her to Jim such as "wedding", "dating" or "relationship", and "child".

### Andy
![Andy_Bernard_wiki]({{<baseurl>}}/images/Andy_Bernard_wiki.png)

Finally, for `Andy` we see "new", potentially linked to the fact that he joined the cast later than the other main characters, as many links to his job: "staff", "office", "manager", "job", "regional", "branch", and "sale". He also had the word "relationship", potentially related to Erin and his deep-rooted need to find love throughout his character arc. Lasly, we found "anger", which relates to his initial character traits of lacking anger management skills.

## Dialogue Analysis

Now we do the same, but looking at the dialogue throughout the series. We hope to gain insights about the way the characters actually talk, which could also indicate their character traits and personalities. 

However, overall we found that the majority of words used in the dialogue, are, as expected, natural interaction language interactions that do not carry much meaning. 

### Michael
![michael_w]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/michael_w.PNG)

In michael's word cloud, we find the names of the people with whom he interacts the most frequently, such as Dwight, Pam and Jan. We also find "party", which fits well with his character's affinity for frequent parties.

### Dwight
![dwight_w]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/dwight_w.PNG)

We find that Dwight says "Michael" a lot, which is very intuitive given that Dwight very frequently screams Michaels name to complain after Jim makes a prank on him.

### Jim
![jim_w]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/jim_w.PNG)

Jim doesn't have many descriptive words. However, we do notice he is often quite sarcastic given the words "really", "right", "alright", though most of this aspect of his personality is reflected in his facial expressions.

### Pam
![pam_w]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/pam_w.PNG)

For Pam one can observe she mainly interacts with Michael in the office, since she is the secretary, and then with Jim. One can tell she is more insecure, with many words such as "think", "sorry", "um" or "uh".

### Andy
![andy_w]({{<baseurl>}}/images/wordclouds/andy_w.PNG)

Finally, from Andy, one can see that he uses "right" a lot, which could make reference to him being a people-pleaser and agreeing to everything. We also see he interacts often with his girlfriend Erin.

### That's what she said!

While it didn't show up in the word clouds, we had to mention Michael Scott's most famous phrase ...

![thats-what-she-said]({{<baseurl>}}/images/thats-what-she-said.gif)

In total Michael uses this joke 24 times throughout the series!
