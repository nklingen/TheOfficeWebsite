# Script

## Basic statistics

We will use a subset of The Office script to gain a deeper analysis of the personality of the characters, their complexity and their interactions with each other.

Let's start by examining the distribution of lines throughout the seasons.

We can see that all of the seasons are more or less even, except for the first one. This is also because the season has only 6 episodes, but one should hold this in mind for further analysis.

Next, we look into which are the characters that have more lines.

We can see that the characters that have the most dialogue are, by far, Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam and Andy. Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam are the main characters throughout the season, and then Andy becomes one of them after Michael leaves, so it makes sense that they have the most screentime and dialogue.

## Interations between the characters

From the script lines, we can see how characters interact with each other and how much.

We can see that the characters that interact with more characters are Michael, Dwight, Jim and Pam which are also the characters that also have the most lines. But we also see that the most part of these interactions are interal amongst these 4 individuals, so that their storylines are very intertwined, rather than each one having an individual one. 

This observed phenomenon matches what we actually see in the series. The series centres arount these four characters, specially some of the relationships between pairs. Mainly, Dwight's and Jim friend-enemy relationship, Michael's and Dwight's shenanigans, Jim's and Pam's romantic relationship and Jim and Michael's complicated work dynamic.
