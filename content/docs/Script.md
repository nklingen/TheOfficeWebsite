# Script

## Number of lines per season

We will use a subset of The Office script to gain a deeper analysis of the personality of the characters and their interactions with each other. We first examije the distribution of lines throughout the seasons.

We can see that all seasons have more or less the same number of lines, except for Season 1. This is also because the first season only has 6 episodes.

## Number of lines per character

Next, we look into how many lines each character has

We can see that the characters that have the most dialogue are, by far, Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam and Andy. Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam are the main characters throughout the series. Andy joins the main cast later and becomes increasingly prominent after Michael leaves. 

## Interations between the characters

From the script lines, we can see how often characters interact with each other.

The characters that interact the most in general are Michael, Dwight, Jim and Pam. Again, these are the characters with most lines in general so it is expected that they also interact the most with other characters overall. But we also see that the majority of interactions are interal amongst these 4 individuals, so that their storylines are very intertwined, rather than each having their individual subplot. 

This reflects what we actually see in the series. The series centres around these four characters, in particular , Dwight's and Jim friend-enemy relationship, Michael's and Dwight's close bond, Jim's and Pam's romantic relationship and Jim and Michael's (often unbalanced) friendship.
