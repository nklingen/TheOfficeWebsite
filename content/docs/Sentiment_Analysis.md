There is also drama thorughout the season, so we will explore the character's emotional developement for the main characters. Finally, we explore the sentiment evolution throughout the seasons and the saddest and happiest characters. 

## Sentiment profile 

From the dialogue, we can analyze the characters' sentiments and determine the distribution of these.

One can see that distribution resembles that of a Gaussian one. The majority of characters fall within a neutral sentiment, and then a few ones are very happy and others very sad.

we will now focus on the sentiment of the main characters, individually, to see which are the happiest and saddest main characters, as shown in the plot below.

One can appreciate that Clark, Michael and Gabe are the happiest characters. It doesn't come as a suprise for Clark, who is an excited intern in the laste season and for Michael, who is always naively optimistic. However, Gabe doesn't come off as one of the happiest characters, but rather emotionless. It could have to do with the subset of the dialogue chosen. On the other hand, we have Stanley, Meredith and Angela. Stanley is always grumpy, Meredith has a messy personal life and is often the victim of some unfortunate incidents in the office and Angela is cold and stern and is rarely seen smiling.
