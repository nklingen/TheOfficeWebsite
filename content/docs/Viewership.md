The first thing we immediately notice is that The Office steadily increases in viewership until season 5. However, it then begins declining in seasons 6 and 7, even before Michael leaves at the end at season 7. In Seasons 8 and 9 where Michael is no longer a part of the cast, the viewership sharply declines until the series ends.

Moreover, we notice a wider variance in viewership in the first seasons. Over time, the variance tapers away, indicating that the show develops a "core" audience that watches all episodes. This is in contrast to Seasons 1 and 5, where we particularly notice a large variance in viewership between episodes of the same season.

We see that the large variance in Season 1 can be explained by viewers who only watched the pilot. The pilot is the second most viewed episode of the Office, with 11.2 million views. Thus, this audience could have been drawn in by the initial hype, or were previous fans the the British version of the show, that did not continue watching after the pilot.

We see that the high variance in Season 5 can be explained by one episode in particular, that received a huge spike in viewership. Noteably, this episode, titled `Stress Relief` originally aired on February 1, 2009, immediately following NBC's broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII. Thus, they attracted a huge audience due to this prime time-slot. It had 22.91 million viewers - making it the most viewed episode of The Office.
