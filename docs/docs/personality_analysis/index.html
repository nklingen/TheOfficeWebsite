  Personality Analysis
  <a class="anchor" href="#personality-analysis">#</a>
</h1>
<p>In this section, we will analyze the characters background based on solely plain text form the wiki pages and their dialogue.</p>
<h2 id="most-descriptive-words">
  Most descriptive words
  <a class="anchor" href="#most-descriptive-words">#</a>
</h2>
<p>We use the pages from <a href="https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page">The Office Wiki</a>, for each character to extract some descriptive adjectives and verbs that define the character&rsquo;s background, lifestyle and personality. There are many characters, so we will focus only of the 5 characters with most screen time in The Office, Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam and Andy.</p>
<p>Generally, we see that a company jargon is very common amongst all three characters, such as &ldquo;office&rdquo;, &ldquo;staff&rdquo;, &ldquo;job&rdquo;, &ldquo;client&rdquo; or &ldquo;company&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="michael">
  Michael
  <a class="anchor" href="#michael">#</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/Michael_Scott_wiki.png" alt="Michael_Scott_wiki" /></p>
<p><code>Michael</code> also has the words &ldquo;parody&rdquo;, &ldquo;manager&rdquo;, and &ldquo;salesman&rdquo;. These words define his fondness for making pariodies of characters, as well as his positions throughout his career at Dunder Mifflin. We also find the word &ldquo;friend&rdquo;, potentially related to his deepest desire to make friendships at work.</p>
<h3 id="dwight">
  Dwight
  <a class="anchor" href="#dwight">#</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/Dwight_Schrute_wiki.png" alt="Dwight_Schrute_wiki" />
For <code>Dwight</code> we see more descriptive words that match his personality, such as &ldquo;german&rdquo;, making reference to his ancestry, &ldquo;farm&rdquo;, where he lives or &ldquo;sheriff&rdquo;, which he volunteers for in his spare time. We also very interestingly see the words &ldquo;family&rdquo; and &ldquo;child&rdquo; amongst the most prominent words. There are even words related to his strong fighting instinct, such as &ldquo;dodge&rdquo;, &ldquo;attack&rdquo;, and &ldquo;fight&rdquo; and &ldquo;war&rdquo;. Lastly, we see &ldquo;beets&rdquo; and &ldquo;bears&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="jim">
  Jim
  <a class="anchor" href="#jim">#</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/jim-dwight.gif" alt="jim-dwight" /></p>
<p><img src="https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/Jim_Halpert_wiki.png" alt="Jim_Halpert_wiki" />
<code>Jim</code> has the words &ldquo;stamford&rdquo;, another branch he was transferred to for a period, as well as &ldquo;prank&rdquo;, since he is constantly pranking Dwight. He has some links to his family with Pam as well, such as &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;relationship&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="pam">
  Pam
  <a class="anchor" href="#pam">#</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/Pam_Beesly_wiki.png" alt="Pam_Beesly_wiki" />
For <code>Pam</code> we see &ldquo;art&rdquo;, which is her passion, and words that link her to Jim such as &ldquo;wedding&rdquo;, &ldquo;dating&rdquo; or &ldquo;relationship&rdquo;, and &ldquo;child&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="andy">
  Andy
  <a class="anchor" href="#andy">#</a>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/Andy_Bernard_wiki.png" alt="Andy_Bernard_wiki" /></p>
<p>Finally, for <code>Andy</code> we see &ldquo;new&rdquo;, potentially linked to the fact that he joined the cast later than the other main characters, as many links to his job: &ldquo;staff&rdquo;, &ldquo;office&rdquo;, &ldquo;manager&rdquo;, &ldquo;job&rdquo;, &ldquo;regional&rdquo;, &ldquo;branch&rdquo;, and &ldquo;sale&rdquo;. He also had the word &ldquo;relationship&rdquo;, potentially related to Erin and his deep-rooted need to find love throughout his character arc. Lasly, we found &ldquo;anger&rdquo;, which relates to his initial character traits of lacking anger management skills.</p>
<h2 id="dialogue">
  Dialogue
  <a class="anchor" href="#dialogue">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s do the same, but looking at their dialogue. We can gain insights about the way they actually talk, which could show a lot about their character.</p>
<p>However in this case, the majority of words used in the dialogue, are, as espected, not that usefull in terms of describing the characters´ personalities, since they are mostly natural interaction language words that do not carry much meaning. There are still some information that we can pick up on.</p>
<p><img src="https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/wordclouds/michael_w.PNG" alt="michael_w" /></p>
<p>One can see the names of the people Michael most interacts with, such as Dwight, Pam and Jan and &ldquo;party&rdquo; seems to be in his mind, since he always wants to turn events into parties.</p>
<p><img src="https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/wordclouds/dwight_w.PNG" alt="dwight_w" /></p>
<p>For Dwight, we see that he interacts a lot with Michael, often by exclaiming his name, and Jim, often complaining about his pranks to Michael. We also see &ldquo;Schrute&rdquo;, his surname, which he makes reference to when talking about his family and his german farmer roots.</p>
<p><img src="https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/wordclouds/jim_w.PNG" alt="jim_w" /></p>
<p>Jim doesn&rsquo;t have many descriptive words, since he is often quite sarcastic, specially when interacting with Michael and Dwight, and he usually says a lot from his facial expressions alone.</p>
<p><img src="https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/wordclouds/pam_w.PNG" alt="pam_w" /></p>
<p>For Pam one can observe she mainly interacts with Michael in the office, since she is the secretary, and then with Jim. One can tell she is more insecure, with words such as &ldquo;think&rdquo;, &ldquo;sorry&rdquo;, &ldquo;um&rdquo; or &ldquo;uh&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/wordclouds/andy_w.PNG" alt="andy_w" /></p>
<p>Finally, from Andy, one can see that he uses &ldquo;right&rdquo; a lot, which could make reference to him being a people-pleaser and agreeing to everything. We also see Erin inhis wordcloud, which is his girlfriend.</p>
<h3 id="thats-what-she-said">
  That&rsquo;s what she said!
  <a class="anchor" href="#thats-what-she-said">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Any The Office fan knows Michael Scott&rsquo;s most famous phrase &hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/thats-what-she-said.gif" alt="thats-what-she-said" /></p>
<p>In total Michael uses this joke 24 times throughout the series!</p>
