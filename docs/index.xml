      <description>Add plot in/out degree distribution
 Analysis of degree distributions #  Inward degree distribution: We see a power-law distribution, which has a large majority of nodes with few in-going links, and few instances of nodes with large in-going degrees. We can explain this by noting that the main characters overwhelmingly have many ingoing links from more minor characters, without referencing those characters in return. While interacctions with main characters are significant for minor characters, they are insignificant in the storyline of the main-characters, leading to a one-sided relationship.</description>

      <description>Ratings per Season #  We overall see the rating climb in seasons 1 and 2, then peak in seasons 3. Season 4 slightly decreases in the averageratings, yet has a much higher variance. Thus the quality between episodes themselves varies much more in this season. We see the decrease in ratings continue until season 7, where it climbs again, before a dramatic decline in season 8.
Analysis of Top Episodes #    Goodbye Michael: This episode is the final episode to feature Michael Scott as the series&amp;rsquo;s main character, and is regarded by many critics as the &amp;ldquo;series finale&amp;rdquo;, as the series received much criticism for a decline in quality after Michael&amp;rsquo;s departure.</description>

      <description>The first thing we immediately notice is that The Office steadily increases in viewership until season 5. However, it then begins declining in seasons 6 and 7, even before Michael leaves at the end at season 7. In Seasons 8 and 9 where Michael is no longer a part of the cast, the viewership sharply declines until the series ends.
Moreover, we notice a wider variance in viewership in the first seasons.</description>
