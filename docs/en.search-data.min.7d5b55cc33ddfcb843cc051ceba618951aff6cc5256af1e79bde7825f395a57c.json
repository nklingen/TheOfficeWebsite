Klingenbrunn as a final project for the course 02805 Social graphs and interactions offered by the Technical University of Denmark.\nEach of the following sections will analyse and visualize different datasets relating to the office.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/TheOfficeWebsite/docs/communities/","title":"Communities","section":"Docs","content":"Communities #  We will use the Louvain method to divide the network into communities of characters in order to see if we can find some intresting groupings from the network alone.\nMethodology #  Results #  This yields 11 communities, which are illustrated in the image below. Each community has a diferent color and labels correspond to the characters that are at the center of each community.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at the members of each community. The following table shows the seven most connected characters, in descending order, for each community.\n   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11     Andy Bernard Erin Hannon Dwight Schrute Jim Halpert Robert California Michael Scott Kelly Kapoor David Wallace Phyllis Vance Kevin Malone Jan Levinson   Walter Bernard Jr. Erin\u0026rsquo;s Mother Angela Martin Pam Beesly Toby Flenderson Holly Flax Darryl Philbin Ryan Howard Karen Filippelli Stanley Hudson Oscar Martinez   Walter Bernard Sr. Erin\u0026rsquo;s Father Robert Lipton Cecelia Halpert Gabe Lewis Creed Bratton Deangelo Vickers Charles Miner Bob Vance Cynthia Michael Scarn   Ellen Bernard Irene Mose Schrute Phillip Halpert Todd Packer Scranton Strangler Pete Miller Nellie Bertram Hannah Smoterich-Barr Melissa Hudson Goldenface   Nick Glenn (Florida) Garbage Helene Beesly Jo Bennett Ed Truck Julius Erving Alan Brand Josh Porter Teri Hudson Pizza Delivery Kid   Sadiq Reed Aunt Shirley Betsy Halpert Cathy Becker Michael Klump Clark Green David Brent Danny Cordray Stacy Astrid Levinson   Cathy Simms  Meredith Palmer William Beesly Jordan Garfield Mr. Flax Jada Philbin Neil Godwin Phyllis' Sister Abby Catherine Zeta-Scarn    The groupings found by the Louvain algorithm proof to be quite insightful, since there are some parallelisms between the characters placed in the same group and how close they are in the series.\nFor example, if we look at community 4, it is formed up of Jim and Pam, their children and family relatives of both. This implies a strong bond between the both of them, and there is one indeed, since they have the main romance storyline throught the series and end up marrying and having a family of their own.\nSimilarly, in 3 we find Angela and Dwight to be the main characters in that community which have an on-and-off relationship during the series and also end up marrying in the last episode. In that same category, we find Robert Lipton, which is Angela´s ex-husband, as wll as Angela\u0026rsquo;s cat, Garbage, and some of Dwight\u0026rsquo;s family members.\nThe trend where romantic partners and family members being placed within the same community is visible: Michael and Holly in 1, Phyllis and Bob in 9, and Andy\u0026rsquo;s and Erin\u0026rsquo;s families in 1 and 2 respectively, amongst others. In case of community 8, corporate characters are grouped together.\nHowever, there are some character\u0026rsquo;s that don\u0026rsquo;t have an obvious bond with the rest of the characters of the community they belong to. For example, Meredith has little interaction with Angela or Dwight, or Oscar with Jan. We would also expect Ryan and Kelly to be placed together, since they are one of the show\u0026rsquo;s couples with most drama.\nAll in all, the communities found from the network have in general a strong cohesion. It is also intresting to point out that these communities are mostly tied together by the personal relationships instead of the categorization we chose for the Network analysis section (main characters, warehouse workers, family members, etc).\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/TheOfficeWebsite/docs/network_analysis/","title":"Network Analysis","section":"Docs","content":" Add plot in/out degree distribution\n Analysis of degree distributions #  Inward degree distribution: We see a power-law distribution, which has a large majority of nodes with few in-going links, and few instances of nodes with large in-going degrees. We can explain this by noting that the main characters overwhelmingly have many ingoing links from more minor characters, without referencing those characters in return. While interacctions with main characters are significant for minor characters, they are insignificant in the storyline of the main-characters, leading to a one-sided relationship. Similarly, the power law defines that a network usually consists of a few hubs that most other nodes are connected to. The magnitude of nodes with 0 ingoing edges is reduced after discarding all nodes not in the GCC. However, we will observe many nodes with no ingoing edges.\nOutward degree distribution: We here see a somewhat Poisson-like distribution. However, we notice some cases where some characters have no outgoing connections. These characters were not removed when creating the GCC as they must still have an ingoing-link connecting them to the giant component. More specifically, they are referenced by a more \u0026ldquo;central\u0026rdquo; character, without them referencing that character in return. This means that the vast majority of characters that are in the GCC have just one ingoing-link.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/TheOfficeWebsite/docs/dialogue/","title":"Personality Analysis","section":"Docs","content":"Analysis of the character\u0026rsquo;s personalities #  In this section, we will analyze the characters background based on solely plain text form the wiki pages and their dialogue.\nMost descriptive words #  We use the pages from The Office Wiki, for each character to extract some descriptive adjectives and verbs that define the character\u0026rsquo;s background, lifestyle and personality. There are many characters, so we will focus only of the 5 characters with most screen time in The Office, Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam and Andy.\nGenerally, we see that a company jargon is very common amongst all three characters, such as \u0026ldquo;office\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;staff\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;job\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;client\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;company\u0026rdquo;.\nMichael also has the words \u0026ldquo;parody\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;manager\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;salesman\u0026rdquo;. These words define his fondness for making pariodies of characters, as well as his positions throughout his career at Dunder Mifflin. We also find the word \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo;, potentially related to his deepest desire to make friendships at work.\nFor Dwight we see more descriptive words that match his personality, such as \u0026ldquo;german\u0026rdquo;, making reference to his ancestry, \u0026ldquo;farm\u0026rdquo;, where he lives or \u0026ldquo;sheriff\u0026rdquo;, which he volunteers for in his spare time. We also very interestingly see the words \u0026ldquo;family\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;child\u0026rdquo; amongst the most prominent words. Lastly, there are some words related to his fighting instinct, such as \u0026ldquo;dodge\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;attack\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;fight\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;war\u0026rdquo;. Lastly, we see \u0026ldquo;beets\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;bears\u0026rdquo;.\nJim has the words \u0026ldquo;stamford\u0026rdquo;, another branch he was transferred to for a period, as well as \u0026ldquo;prank\u0026rdquo;, since he is constantly pranking Dwight. He has some links to his family with Pam as well, such as \u0026ldquo;daughter\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;relationship\u0026rdquo;.\nFor Pam we see \u0026ldquo;art\u0026rdquo;, which is her passion, and words that link her to Jim such as \u0026ldquo;wedding\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;dating\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;relationship\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;child\u0026rdquo;.\nFinally, for Andy we see \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo;, potentially linked to the fact that he joined the cast later than the other main characters, as many links to his job: \u0026ldquo;staff\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;office\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;manager\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;job\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;regional\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;branch\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;sale\u0026rdquo;. He also had the word \u0026ldquo;relationship\u0026rdquo;, potentially related to Erin and his deep-rooted need to find love throughout his character arc. Lasly, we found \u0026ldquo;anger\u0026rdquo;, which relates to his initial character traits of lacking anger management skills.\nDialogue #  Now let\u0026rsquo;s do the same, but looking at their dialogue. We can gain insights about the way they actually talk, which could show a lot about their character.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/TheOfficeWebsite/docs/ratings/","title":"Ratings","section":"Docs","content":"Ratings per Season #  We overall see the rating climb in seasons 1 and 2, then peak in seasons 3. Season 4 slightly decreases in the averageratings, yet has a much higher variance. Thus the quality between episodes themselves varies much more in this season. We see the decrease in ratings continue until season 7, where it climbs again, before a dramatic decline in season 8.\nAnalysis of Top Episodes #    Goodbye Michael: This episode is the final episode to feature Michael Scott as the series\u0026rsquo;s main character, and is regarded by many critics as the \u0026ldquo;series finale\u0026rdquo;, as the series received much criticism for a decline in quality after Michael\u0026rsquo;s departure. We can make the case that Michael was the true main character. After he leaves, we see that the ratings crumble and the show cannot recover.\n  In Stress Relief, Dwight stages a fire in the office to test the office\u0026rsquo;s fire safety skills, but things go from bad to worse when Stanley suffers a heart attack, causing Michael to come up with ways to relieve stress in the office, including a comedic roast of himself. Meanwhile, Andy, Jim, and Pam watch an illegally downloaded movie at work guest-starring Jack Black, Jessica Alba and Cloris Leachman. reference The chaotic cold open scene becomes one of the top fan favorite scenes from the entire show. Both parts of Stress Relief originally aired together on February 1, 2009, immediately following NBC\u0026rsquo;s broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII, and The Office writers and producers sought to attract newcomers to the series with the expected increase in viewership. It had 22.9 million viewers - making it one of the most viewed episode of The Office.\n  Analysis of Worst Episodes #   Get The Girl featured Andy driving across the country to Tallahassee to track down Erin. He tries to serenade her in an extremely cringy scene and just does quite a few rather absurd things in an attempt to win Erin\u0026rsquo;s heart. The Andy-Erin relationship received a lot of criticism by fans. reference Even the actress portraying Erin, Ellie Kemper, never thought Andy and Erin were a good match. \u0026ldquo;Is that terrible to say? I don’t know, I felt like Andy was a bit too childish. I don’t think he was ready to take care of Erin the way she needed to be. I think Erin was ready to take care of him, but I felt like it was uneven in that respect.\u0026rdquo; reference We also want to discuss the biggest outlier in the ratings: In The Banker, an investment banker comes to the office to speak with Toby, since the company has recently been bought out. This episode is just montages of previous episodes, with very little new content.

Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam are the main characters throughout the season, and then Andy becomes one of them after Michael leaves, so it makes sense that they have the most screentime and dialogue.\n\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;\nInterations between the characters #  From the script lines, we can see how characters interact with each other and how much.\nWe can see that the characters that interact with more characters are Michael, Dwight, Jim and Pam which are also the characters that also have the most lines. But we also see that the most part of these interactions are interal amongst these 4 individuals, so that their storylines are very intertwined, rather than each one having an individual one.\nThis observed phenomenon matches what we actually see in the series. The series centres arount these four characters, specially some of the relationships between pairs. Mainly, Dwight\u0026rsquo;s and Jim friend-enemy relationship, Michael\u0026rsquo;s and Dwight\u0026rsquo;s shenanigans, Jim\u0026rsquo;s and Pam\u0026rsquo;s romantic relationship and Jim and Michael\u0026rsquo;s complicated work relationship\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/TheOfficeWebsite/docs/sentiment_analysis/","title":"Sentiment Analysis","section":"Docs","content":"Sentiment Analysis #  In this section, we will see which characters are the saddest and which are the happiest and which are more emotionally stable and unstable. There is also drama thorughout the season, so we will explore the character\u0026rsquo;s emotional developement for the main characters. Finally, we explore the sentiment evolution throughout the seasons and the saddest and happiest characters.\nSentiment profile of the characters #  From the dialogue, we can analyze the characters' sentiments and determine the distribution of these.\nOne can see that distribution resembles that of a Gaussian one. The majority of characters fall within a neutral sentiment, and then a few ones are very happy and others very sad.\nwe will now focus on the sentiment of the main characters, individually, to see which are the happiest and saddest main characters, as shown in the plot below.\nOne can appreciate that Clark, Michael and Gabe are the happiest characters. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t come as a suprise for Clark, who is an excited intern in the laste season and for Michael, who is always naively optimistic. However, Gabe doesn\u0026rsquo;t come off as one of the happiest characters, but rather emotionless. It could have to do with the subset of the dialogue chosen. On the other hand, we have Stanley, Meredith and Angela. Stanley is always grumpy, Meredith has a messy personal life and is often the victim of some unfortunate incidents in the office and Angela is cold and stern and is rarely seen smiling. Thus, the sentiments computed seem to be in general quite accurate.\nSentiment developement of the main characters #  We will focus on the character devlopement of the main characters: Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam and Andy.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/TheOfficeWebsite/docs/viewership/","title":"Viewership","section":"Docs","content":"The first thing we immediately notice is that The Office steadily increases in viewership until season 5. However, it then begins declining in seasons 6 and 7, even before Michael leaves at the end at season 7. In Seasons 8 and 9 where Michael is no longer a part of the cast, the viewership sharply declines until the series ends.\nMoreover, we notice a wider variance in viewership in the first seasons. Over time, the variance tapers away, indicating that the show develops a \u0026ldquo;core\u0026rdquo; audience that watches all episodes. This is in contrast to Seasons 1 and 5, where we particularly notice a large variance in viewership between episodes of the same season.\nWe see that the large variance in Season 1 can be explained by viewers who only watched the pilot. The pilot is the second most viewed episode of the Office, with 11.2 million views. Thus, this audience could have been drawn in by the initial hype, or were previous fans the the British version of the show, that did not continue watching after the pilot.\nWe see that the high variance in Season 5 can be explained by one episode in particular, that received a huge spike in viewership. Noteably, this episode, titled Stress Relief originally aired on February 1, 2009, immediately following NBC\u0026rsquo;s broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII. Thus, they attracted a huge audience due to this prime time-slot. It had 22.91 million viewers - making it the most viewed episode of The Office.\n{{/\u0026lt; plotly json=\u0026quot;/images/test.json\u0026quot; height=\u0026ldquo;400px\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;/}}\n{{/\u0026lt; plotly json=\u0026ldquo;https://nklingen.github.io/TheOfficeWebsite//images/test.json\u0026rdquo; height=\u0026ldquo;400px\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;/}}\n"}]
